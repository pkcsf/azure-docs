# Integrate Azure Active Directory logs with Splunk using Azure Monitor (preview)

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Azure Active Directory logs with Splunk using Azure Monitor. First, you'd need to route the logs to an Azure event hub, then integrate it with Splunk.

## Prerequisites

1. Azure Event Hub containing Azure AD activity logs. Learn how to [stream your activity logs to Event Hub](reporting-azure-monitor-diagnostics-azure-event-hub.md). 
2. Use the following [instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureMonitorAddonForSplunk/blob/master/README.md) to download the Azure monitor add-on for Splunk and configure your Splunk instance.

## Tutorial 

1. Open your Splunk instance and click **Data Summary**.

2. Navigate to the **Sourcetypes** tab and select **amal: aadal:audit**

3. You'll see the Azure AD activity logs as shown in the following figure.

> [!NOTE]
> If you cannot install an add-on in your Splunk instance (for example, if you're using a proxy or running on Splunk Cloud), you can forward these events to the Splunk HTTP Event Collector usingÂ this [Azure Function which is triggered by new messages in the event hub](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureFunctionforSplunkVS)."
