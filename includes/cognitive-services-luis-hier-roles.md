**Question**: Should you use an hierarchical entity or a pattern including simple entity with roles? 

**Answer**: That depends. Roles work with patterns and hierarchical entities work in intents. Roles with patterns accomplish the same method but with fewer examples but must in the format of a pattern. If the utterances donâ€™t have a clear pattern, you need to use hierarchical entities. 

|Hierarchical entities|Simple entity with roles|
|--|--|
|must have example utterances with child entities labeled in intents|must have example utterances, **roles can't be labeled in intents**|
|can use in patterns|**must** use in patterns|
|may need **more** example utterances in intent|may need **less** example utterances in intent|
